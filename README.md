Hi my name is HoppingWhale.
I use github because I want to learn coding and right now I focus on Python. Later I hope to also learn JavaScript and C++. 
I am a very new student to the arts!
For questions I am  available at jonahjimmink@gmail.com

HoppingWhale/HoppingWhale is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
